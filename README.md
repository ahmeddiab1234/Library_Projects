## How It Works
The system is divided into three main components:
1. **FrontEnd**: Handles user interaction, displaying menus, and collecting input.
2. **BackEnd**: Manages the data, including books and users, and performs operations like adding, borrowing, and returning books.
3. **LibraryManager**: Acts as the bridge between the FrontEnd and BackEnd, orchestrating the flow of the program.
